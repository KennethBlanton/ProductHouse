# AI Product Development Assistant - Masterplan

[Previous sections remain the same, with the following additions:]

## 11. Masterplan Review and Iteration Workflow

### Collaborative Review Process
1. **Initial Masterplan Generation**
   - Automatically created after requirements gathering conversation
   - Assigned a unique version identifier (e.g., v1.0)
   - Stored in central repository

2. **Review Interaction Model**
   ```
   [Generated Masterplan]
         │
         ▼
   [Development Resource Review Interface]
         │
         ├── Comment on Specific Sections
         ├── Suggest Modifications
         ├── Request AI Clarification
         └── Propose Version Update
   ```

### Detailed Interaction Capabilities

#### Comment and Annotation System
- Ability to add inline comments to specific sections
- Mention team members using @username
- Tag comments with categories:
  * Clarification Needed
  * Potential Risk
  * Suggested Modification
  * Technical Concern

#### AI-Assisted Review Workflow
- Develop conversational interface for review process
- Allow development resources to:
  * Ask AI to elaborate on specific sections
  * Request justification for design choices
  * Prompt AI to refine or expand on particular requirements

#### Version Control and Tracking
- Semantic versioning for masterplans (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- Maintain complete change history
- Ability to:
  * Revert to previous versions
  * Compare version differences
  * Understand rationale behind each change

### Interaction Example Workflow
1. Development resource opens masterplan
2. Reviews initial generated document
3. Adds comments/suggestions
4. Triggers AI-assisted review conversation
5. AI provides additional context or modifications
6. Option to:
   - Accept suggested changes
   - Manually edit
   - Request further clarification
7. Generate new masterplan version

### Technical Implementation Considerations
- Real-time collaboration features
- Secure access controls
- Audit logging of all interactions
- Performance optimization for version tracking

## 12. Collaboration Modes
- Solo Review
- Team Collaborative Review
- Async Feedback Collection
- Real-time Discussion Mode

## 13. Advanced AI Interaction Capabilities
- Contextual understanding of review comments
- Ability to defend or explain original requirements
- Suggest alternative approaches based on review feedback
- Identify potential conflicts or inconsistencies

## 14. Review Success Metrics
- Time spent in review process
- Number of iterations per masterplan
- Quality of AI-suggested modifications
- Team satisfaction with collaborative process
